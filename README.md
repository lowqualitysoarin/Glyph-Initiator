### Glyph Initiator
Glyph Initiator is an application made specifically for Nothing Phones that allows the user to control the phone's Glyph Interface without needing root
via automation apps (at the moment its confirmed to work on Macrodroid), by sending intents to this application.

## What can I do with it?
It allows you to create automations that interacts with your Glyph Interface, e.g. Glyph Alarm, Glyph Charge Indicator, Glyph Bluetooth Connection effect, etc...
